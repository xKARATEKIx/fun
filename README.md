This task is separate from our project with a budget!

Create a separate repository for this task.



Use alert, confirm, prompt functions to communicate with the user.


Write a game bot.

"Guessing a random number from 1 to 100."



What the program should do:

- Ask the user, "Guess a number from 1 to 100".
- If the user's number is higher, the bot displays "Guess the number is lower" and prompts you to enter a new option;
- if the user's number is lower, the bot displays "The guess is higher" and prompts for a new choice;
- if the user has not entered a number, the bot displays "Enter a number!" and offers to enter a new option;
- if the user clicks "Cancel", the game ends and the message "Game over" is displayed.

- if the user's number is equal to the guessed number, the game ends and displays the message "Congratulations, you guessed it!!!".



The program must be executed using recursion, without a single loop.

The guessed number must be stored "in a loop"





COMPLICATED TASK: 

To complete the functionality of the game bot.



The number of user attempts should be limited to 10


- if the user's number is higher, the bot displays "The guessed number is lower, there are attempts left..." and offers to enter a new variant;
- if the user's number is lower, the bot displays "The guessing number is higher, the remaining attempts ..." and offers to enter a new variant;
- if the user enters the correct number, the bot displays "Congratulations, you guessed it!!! Would you like to play again?", pressing OK restarts the game (10 tries again and a new number guessed)
- if the user has not entered a number, it displays the message "Enter a number!" and prompts the user to enter a new option;
- if the user presses "Cancel", the game displays a farewell message and ends.
- If the attempts are over, the program reports, "Attempts are over, do you want to play again?"



The program must be executed using recursion, without a single loop.


The number and the remaining number of attempts must be stored "in the loop".
